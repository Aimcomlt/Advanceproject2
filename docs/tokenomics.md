## AuthorCoin Utility
- **Governance Power:** Grants voting weight within StoryDAO proportional to staked balances.
- **Staking Rewards:** Readers lock tokens to amplify highlight rewards and unlock curated drops.
- **Treasury Medium:** Used for grants, bounties, and cross-panel funding streams.
- **Access Tiers:** Token thresholds unlock premium narrative arcs, early releases, and co-author residencies.

## Emission Schedule
| Phase              | Duration     | Emission Rate (AC) | Notes                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Genesis Bootstrap  | 0-6 months   | 2,000,000 / month  | Liquidity seeding + author incentives |

## Distribution Mechanics
- **Dynamic Bonding Curve:** Primary sales adjust price based on outstanding supply and engagement rate.
- **Highlight Rewards:** ConcessionChain triggers micro-distributions to ReaderProfileNFT holders achieving consensus.
- **Author Residuals:** Royalty splits encoded in BookNFT metadata flow automatically to AuthorCoin staking pools.
- **Treasury Backstop:** Portion of secondary market fees auto-routes to TransparentTreasury for runway preservation.

## Incentive Alignment
1. **Authors:** Earn AuthorCoin from initial sales, staking yield, and retroactive grants for high-impact narratives.
2. **Readers:** Accumulate tokens through highlights, curation, and governance participation.
3. **Curators:** Receive boosted rewards when their recommended proposals pass and deliver measurable outcomes.
4. **Guardians:** Timelock custodians earn service fees paid in AuthorCoin for maintaining operational security.

## Sink Mechanisms
- Premium publishing tools and analytics dashboards require AuthorCoin expenditure.
- Governance proposal deposits are partially burned to mitigate spam.
- Cross-chain bridging includes adjustable burn/mint ratios to preserve economic parity.

## Treasury Policy
- Maintain 24-month operating runway split between stablecoins and AuthorCoin reserves.
- Adopt quadratic funding rounds twice per year for panel-specific initiatives.
- Implement on-chain streaming payments for long-term residencies and research grants.

## Reporting and Transparency
- Publish quarterly treasury statements referencing on-chain data and IPFS-hosted audits.
- Provide real-time dashboard metrics: staking APY, highlight reward velocity, liquidity depth.
- Maintain public governance forum with decision rationale and performance retrospectives.
